Translates text into furry-readable format

## Examples
Here is the sheer amount of brainrot this neurotoxin can leak into a string of text:

```
According to all known laws
of aviation,
 :
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
 :
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
 :
The bee, of course, flies anyway
 :
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
```

This insightful poem is now mutilated into

```
accowdwing two aww knawwn waws
awf avwiashawn,
 :
thewe is nwo way a bwee
shawuwd be abwe two fwy.
 :
its wings awe tawo smwaww two gwet
its fwat wittwe bawdy awff the gwawund.
 :
the bwee, awf cawuwse, fwies anyway
 :
bwecwause bwees dawn't cwawe
whwat hwumwans thwink is impawsswibwe.
```

And worse of all it's slowly being improved
