Translates text into furry-readable format

## Examples
Here is the sheer amount of brainrot this neurotoxin can leak into a string of text
using the Bee Movie script as an example:

```
According to all known laws
of aviation,
 :
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
 :
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
 :
The bee, of course, flies anyway
 :
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
```

This insightful poem is now mutilated into

```
accowrdwing two awl knawwn waws
awf avwiashawn,
 :
theer is nwo way a bwee
showwd be able two fwy.
 :
its wings awe twoo smwawl two gwet
its fwat wittle bawdy awff the gwownd.
 :
the bwee, awf cowwse, fwies anyway
 :
bwecwause bwees dawn't cwawe 
whwat hwumwans thwink is impawsswible.
```

And worse of all it's slowly being improved

## Usage

Simply run:

`__init__.py /pwaf/two/yaw/vwictim/hwere.txt`
to input a file

or:

`python3 __init__.py`
to input text through terminal.

Your unholy creations will also be stored in your current directory as `out.txt`
